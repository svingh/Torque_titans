          <h2>The Legacy of the Chevrolet Camaro</h2>

          <p>
            Shaking the very earth itself in 1966 released as direct challenge to the Ford's stallion, the <strong>Chevrolet Camaro</strong> was built for speed and style.
            With that bold long hood, stunning short deck, and that aggressive design, 
            the one and only Camaro did not waste its time in carving its spot into the muscle car world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first generation of Camero's called Z/28 dominated most roads, while the SS and COPO edition showed no problems
            shredding those drag strips. After a brief production pause back in 2002,
            the Camaro for the second time took the market by storm with its return in 2010, 
            reigniting the same old feeling brought by new era of American muscle.

                The sixth generation Camaro still competing toe to toe with Mustangs is a top notch 
                blend of  performance and technology injected into the classic muscle DNA. 
                Available in coupe or convertible,
                here are the key trims:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>LT1 / SS:</strong> 6.2L V8 | 455 hp | 0–100 km/h in => 4.0s</li>
                <li><strong>ZL1:</strong> 6.2L Supercharged V8 | 650 hp | 0–100 km/h in => 3.5s</li>
                <li><strong>1LE Track Package:</strong> Race-tuned suspension, performance cooling, and Brembo brakes</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The ZL1 variant of the camero now comes with a 6 speed manual 
                or a 10 speed automatic and makes use of innovative
                 magnetic ride control to hug those corners with spot on precision.
