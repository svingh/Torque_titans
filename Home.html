        <p>
          The Mustang the first one on the streets and faster than most people think
          launched what can be known as a revolution back in 1964 and came to be known as the face of the pony car era.
          Known for that powerful throttling V8 engines and that sleek fastback silhouette nobody ever went wrong with a Mustang, 
          the Mustang quickly beacme and still continues to be a symbol of
          American performance and rebellious spirit.

        <p>
          Bold, aggressive, and the unrelentingly powerful are the words that are still not enough to define, 
          the Challenger, the beast that roared onto the streets of Florida in 1970 still roars loud even through the last call.
          With that bold and fearless wide stance and the uplift brought by the modern Hellcat reinventions,
          the Challenger is a beast that refuses to be tamed year after year.

        <p>
          Built to take on the horse (Mustang), the Camaro which can be doughtly labled as the one that
          brought style and muscle together in a car like no other had ever though of.
          While the modern day cars like challanger still take pride in the retro look camero each year fetures a new bold look 
          that never failed to impress the new generations. 
          From the Z/28 classics to the track hungry ZL1, the Camaro is Chevrolet’s call to the streets to conquer the 
          performance
          arms race.
