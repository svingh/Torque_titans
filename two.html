          <h2>The Legacy of the Dodge Challenger</h2>

          <p>
            When first launched back in 1970, the <strong>Dodge Challenger</strong> was Mopar’s ultimate 
            answer to the pony car craze. the modern day Hellcat is an ultimate answer to the dominating history of stangs.
            It shared a platform with the Plymouth Barracuda but stood apart with bold styling, a longer wheelbase, and a broad engine lineup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dodge challenger quickly became iconic due to the bold aggressive look and that fear striking 
            performance — especially when we talk about the 
             legendary and historic models like 426 HEMI and R/T that still shine to this date.
            after a little break from Dodge, the Challenger was back in 2008 and climbed to the top earning its spot as the most menacing muscle car on the market.

              <p>The final years of the Challenger in itself proved to be a nerve recking thunderous sendoff, 
                easily featuring one of the most powerful V8 engines that were ever put into a "street legal" 
                car doing 0-100 kmph in 1.66 seconds:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenger R/T:</strong> 5.7L V8 | 375 hp | 0–100 km/h in => 5.3s</li>
                <li><strong>SRT Hellcat:</strong> 6.2L Supercharged V8 | 717–807 hp | 0–100 km/h in => 3.6s</li>
                <li><strong>SRT Demon 170 (Limited):</strong> 6.2L Supercharged V8 | 1025 hp | 0–100 km/h in => 1.66s (on E85 fuel!)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Rear-wheel drive topped with optional AWD on select trims, the Challenger is a 
                perfect symphony between brute power with bold style.
